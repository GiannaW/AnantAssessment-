# AnantAssessment-


Below are links along with Screenshots of the work I have done so far for the Anant Assessment



Demonstrate basic knowledge general rapid prototyping no code platform as a service
  The Company I used for this platform was Airtable.

Demonstrate basic knowledge general automation platform platforms as a service

Here I used Microsoft Flow as a general automation platform that notifies a user if the hashtag '#atant' is used.
The notification is sent in an email with the host email as 'Gw0064a@american.edu'and the recipient is 
' Gwpierocks10@gmail.com.  This a basic low-level automation but after looking at all the features Microsoft Flow 
offers I believe this a great platform for GAP. I tried connecting it to google sheets but my connection was not working.
