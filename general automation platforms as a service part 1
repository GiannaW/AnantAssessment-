Here I used Microsoft Flow as a general automation platform that notifies a user if the hashtag '#atant' is used. The notification is sent in an email with the host email as 'Gw0064a@american.edu'and the recipient is ' Gwpierocks10@gmail.com.  This a basic low-level automation but after looking at all the features Microsoft Flow offers I believe this a great platform for GAP. I tried connecting it to google sheets but my connection was not working.
